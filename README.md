# NBA Shot Data

This project takes data from all shots in the NBA over 20 seasons (2003-04 to 2023-24). I wanted to see how shot selection has changed over the years.

The NBA_Shot_Data.pdf is the best way to view my findings. It includes graphs and commentary on the data trends. 

I include the raw code in nba_shot_data.ipynb, but I cleared the output due to the size of the file being too large.
